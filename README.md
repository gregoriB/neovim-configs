#### Neovim config

### Setup

Install to the Neovim config folder, usually at `~/.configs/nvim/`

Install packages by running `:PackageSync`

Run `:Mason` and install `rust-analyzer` and `codelldb`, or else the Rust debugger won't work.

For code formatting, make sure rustfmt is installed on the machine(not with Mason)

### Styling

Preferred font is [CodeNewRoman](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
